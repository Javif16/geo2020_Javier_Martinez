This program will include all the complementary used to either compare or improve the 
classification process.

It will include possiblities to include geological maps to check if classification is
correct, as well as SAR or optical data that can be used to enhance the identification
process.

The file will test the robustness of the algorithms against different conditions and
analyse how it performs using the performance metrics from the 'performance' file.
