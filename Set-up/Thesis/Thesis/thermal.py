'''
File that will be used to obtain all the thermal images and extract the desired attributes,
such as emissivity or surface temperature.

It will be able to extract files in formats like GeoTIFF or HDF.

Normalization of images will also take place here, in order for the deep learning algorithms 
to always take the same type of data.

Then, the necessary images or attributes will be able to be passed to other files, in order 
for the deep learning algorithms established in other files to work with the output produced
in this program.
