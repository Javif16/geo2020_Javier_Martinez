This file will contain the main Convolutional Neural Network, with which thermal image
classification will be performed and achieved. 

Here, the program will also be trained and tested, with parameter tunning taking place 
here as well.

It will be able to work both with a single image or a set of thermal iamges.

Extraction will be tested with different architectures to improve efficiency (ResNet 
blocks) and batch normalization.

The program should output the  correct identification of different rock and soil types 
when presented with either a single or a set of thermal images.
