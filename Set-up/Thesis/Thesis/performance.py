'''
This program will be used to test the performance of each of the algorithms developed
in the other files, such as 'CNN', 'ConvLSTM' and 'CNN-LSTM'.

It will define the loss function (categorical cross-entropy).

Then, track the performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 
the desired model during its training period.
Confusion matrices will be used to identify missclassifications.
It should also monitor temporal predictions to check that consistency is maintained 
across sequences.
